This is a project I worked on 2 years ago to understand impurities in 2D metal sheets. This is one of the first application of Machine Learning in condensed matter physics. 

The preface of the problem is that giving a set distribution of impurities in metals, it is easy to figure out the relation among the distribution of charges in the metals when applied an external E-field or B-field. The reverse problem is extremely difficult as it involves matrix inversion.

We use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to study the impurities of metal. The training data used is a local density of state of the electron in the metal. The output should give us the correct value of B-field, E-field applied to the metal and the distribution of our impurities.

You can find the codes, data generation method and the network here! I've also put up some results and a final poster and presentation to consolidate our results. 

Thank you!
